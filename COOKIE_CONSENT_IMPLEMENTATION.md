# Cookie Consent Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the cookie consent implementation for the ShineBridge Empowerment Network (SBEN) website. The implementation ensures GDPR compliance and provides users with full control over their cookie preferences.

## Features

### 1. Cookie Consent Banner
- **Modern Design**: Beautiful, responsive banner with smooth animations using Framer Motion
- **User-Friendly**: Clear options for accepting all, rejecting non-essential, or customizing preferences
- **Backdrop**: Semi-transparent backdrop to focus user attention on the consent decision
- **Automatic Display**: Shows to new visitors after a 1-second delay for better UX

### 2. Cookie Categories
The implementation includes three types of cookies:

#### Necessary Cookies (Always Active)
- Essential for website functionality
- Cannot be disabled
- Includes: page navigation, secure areas access, cookie preference storage

#### Analytics Cookies (Optional)
- Google Analytics integration
- Tracks page views, user behavior, and traffic sources
- Helps improve website performance
- Users can opt-in or opt-out

#### Marketing Cookies (Optional)
- Advertising and remarketing
- Personalized content delivery
- Users can opt-in or opt-out

### 3. Cookie Settings Management
- **Footer Link**: "Cookie Settings" link in the footer for easy access
- **Preference Dialog**: Users can modify their choices at any time
- **Persistent Storage**: Preferences saved in localStorage
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Records when consent was given

### 4. Integration with Google Tag Manager
- Automatic consent mode updates
- Respects user preferences for analytics and advertising
- Updates gtag consent on preference changes

## Files Created/Modified

   - Accessible from footer
   - Allows users to manage preferences after initial consent

3. **`COOKIE_CONSENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** (this file)
   - Documentation for the implementation

### Modified Files
1. **`src/components/Layout.tsx`**
   - Added CookieConsent component

2. **`src/components/PageLayout.tsx`**
   - Added CookieConsent component

   - Imported CookieSettings component

4. **`src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.tsx`**
   - Enhanced cookie policy section
   - Added detailed information about cookie types
   - Added instructions for managing preferences

## How It Works

### First Visit
1. User visits the website
2. After 1 second, the cookie consent banner appears with a backdrop
3. User can choose:
   - **Accept All**: Grants consent for all cookie types
   - **Reject Non-Essential**: Only allows necessary cookies
   - **Customize**: Opens preferences panel to select specific cookie types

### Preference Storage
Preferences are stored in localStorage with the following keys:
- `sben-cookie-consent`: JSON object with user preferences
- `sben-cookie-consent-timestamp`: ISO timestamp of consent
- `silktideCookieChoice_necessary`: "true" (for compatibility)
- `silktideCookieChoice_analytics`: "true" or "false"
- `silktideCookieChoice_marketing`: "true" or "false"

### Subsequent Visits
1. System checks for existing consent in localStorage
2. If found, applies saved preferences automatically
3. If not found, displays the banner again

### Managing Preferences Later
1. User clicks "Cookie Settings" in the footer
2. Dialog opens showing current preferences
3. User can toggle analytics and marketing cookies
4. Changes are saved immediately with real-time GTM updates

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Mechanism
We use **localStorage** instead of IP-based tracking because:
- IP-based tracking requires server-side implementation
- localStorage is the standard approach for cookie consent
- It's more privacy-friendly (data stays on user's device)
- It's GDPR compliant
- It works across page reloads and sessions

### Google Tag Manager Integration
```javascript
gtag('consent', 'update', {
  analytics_storage: prefs.analytics ? 'granted' : 'denied',
  ad_storage: prefs.marketing ? 'granted' : 'denied',
  ad_user_data: prefs.marketing ? 'granted' : 'denied',
  ad_personalization: prefs.marketing ? 'granted' : 'denied',
});
```

### Animations
- Uses Framer Motion for smooth entry/exit animations
- Spring physics for natural movement
- Backdrop blur effect for modern look

## Privacy Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
✅ Clear consent mechanism  
✅ Granular control over cookie types  
✅ Easy opt-out  
✅ Transparent information  
✅ User can withdraw consent  
✅ Privacy policy updated  

### Best Practices
✅ Consent before non-essential cookies  
✅ Clear categorization  
✅ Easy access to settings  
✅ Persistent storage of preferences  
✅ Respects user choices  

## Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- Falls back gracefully if localStorage is disabled
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Banner appears on first visit
- [x] "Accept All" grants all permissions
- [x] "Reject Non-Essential" only allows necessary cookies
- [x] "Customize" shows preferences panel
- [x] Preferences are saved and persisted
- [x] Banner doesn't show on subsequent visits if consent given
- [x] Cookie Settings link in footer works
- [x] Settings dialog displays current preferences correctly
- [x] Toggle switches update preferences in real-time
- [x] Privacy policy section is comprehensive

### Testing in Development
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Reload the page
3. Verify banner appears
4. Test all three options
5. Verify preferences are saved
6. Reload and verify banner doesn't reappear

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Cookie Policy Page**: Create a dedicated cookie policy page
2. **Analytics Dashboard**: Show what data is collected
3. **Consent Expiry**: Auto-expire consent after 12 months
4. **Multi-language**: Translate consent text
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different consent flows
6. **Server-side Tracking**: For IP-based unique visitor tracking
