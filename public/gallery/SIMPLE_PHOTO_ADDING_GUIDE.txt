SIMPLE PHOTO ADDING GUIDE
=========================

‚úÖ WHAT'S NOW WORKING:
- Pure image grid (no cards, no text)
- Click any image to view full screen
- Filter by category to see only images from that folder
- Images automatically load from subfolders

üìÅ HOW TO ADD PHOTOS:

STEP 1: Add photos to subfolders
- Put education photos in: public/gallery/education/
- Put healthcare photos in: public/gallery/healthcare/
- Put community photos in: public/gallery/community/
- etc.

STEP 2: Update the code (only one place!)
In src/pages/Gallery.tsx, find the getCategoryImages function and add your photo paths:

EXAMPLE:
```javascript
education: [
  "/gallery/education/student-workshop-1.jpg",
  "/gallery/education/classroom-activity-2.jpg",
  "/gallery/education/training-session-3.jpg"
],
healthcare: [
  "/gallery/healthcare/clinic-opening.jpg",
  "/gallery/healthcare/health-workshop.jpg"
],
community: [
  "/gallery/community/meeting-1.jpg",
  "/gallery/community/event-2.jpg"
]
```

STEP 3: That's it!
- Photos automatically appear in the grid
- Filter by category to see only photos from that folder
- Click any image to view full screen
