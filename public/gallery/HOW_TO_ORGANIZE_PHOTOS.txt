HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR PHOTOS
============================

You already have photos in the main gallery folder. Here's how to organize them:

CURRENT PHOTOS (already in gallery folder):

- And many more...

STEP 1: ORGANIZE PHOTOS INTO SUBFOLDERS
Move your photos into the appropriate subfolders:

education/          - Photos of students, classrooms, workshops, training
healthcare/         - Photos of medical activities, clinics, health workshops
women-empowerment/  - Photos of women's programs, training, meetings
digital-literacy/   - Photos of computer training, digital skills
environmental/      - Photos of tree planting, cleanup, environmental work
community/          - Photos of community meetings, gatherings, activities
volunteer/          - Photos of volunteer activities, helping others
partnership/        - Photos of partnership meetings, collaborations
events/            - Photos of celebrations, special events, ceremonies

STEP 2: UPDATE THE GALLERY CODE
In src/pages/Gallery.tsx, update the galleryImages array with your organized photos:

EXAMPLE:
{
  id: 1,
  src: "/gallery/education/student-workshop-2024.jpg",
  alt: "Students in workshop",
  title: "Student Workshop 2024",
  description: "Students learning new skills",
  category: "education"
}

STEP 3: RENAME PHOTOS (Optional)
You can rename your photos to be more descriptive:
- "WhatsApp Image 2025-08-23 at 12.42.38 PM.jpeg" → "community-meeting-2024.jpg"
- "WhatsApp Image 2025-08-23 at 12.42.37 PM (3).jpeg" → "education-workshop-2024.jpg"

STEP 4: ADD MORE PHOTOS
As you get more photos, just add them to the appropriate subfolder and update the galleryImages array.

The gallery will automatically filter photos by category and allow searching!
