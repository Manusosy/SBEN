DONATION PAGE IMAGE GUIDE
=========================

âœ… WHAT I'VE FIXED:
- Removed the dark orange background
- Made the section clean and white with subtle borders
- Added clear instructions on how to add your image

ðŸ“¸ HOW TO ADD YOUR IMAGE:

STEP 1: Prepare Your Image
- Save your image in the public folder (e.g., public/donation-hero.jpg)
- Recommended size: 400x300 pixels or larger
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP

STEP 2: Replace the Placeholder
In src/pages/Donate.tsx, find this section (around line 315):

FIND THIS:
```jsx
<div className="text-center">
  <Heart className="w-16 h-16 mx-auto mb-4 text-gray-400" />
  <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">Add your impactful image here</p>
  <p className="text-gray-500 text-xs mt-2">Recommended: 400x300px or larger</p>
</div>
```

REPLACE WITH:
```jsx
<img 
  src="/donation-hero.jpg" 
  alt="Impactful community image"
  className="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-xl"
/>
```

STEP 3: Update the Image Path
Change "/donation-hero.jpg" to your actual image path:
- If your image is in public/images/ â†’ "/images/your-image.jpg"
- If your image is in public/ â†’ "/your-image.jpg"
- If your image is in public/donations/ â†’ "/donations/your-image.jpg"

ðŸŽ¯ EXAMPLE IMAGE PATHS:
- "/lovable-uploads/community-photo.jpg"
- "/gallery/education/workshop-photo.jpg"
- "/donation-impact-photo.jpg"

ðŸ’¡ TIP: The image will automatically fit the container and maintain its aspect ratio with rounded corners!
